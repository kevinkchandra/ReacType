**ReacType** is a rapid prototyping tool that allows users _visualize_ their application architecture dynamically, employing a _drag-and-drop canvas display_ and an interactive, _real-time component code preview_ that can be exported as a **React** app for developers employing React component architecture alongside the comprehensive type-checking of **TypeScript**. In other words, **you can draw prototypes and export React / TypeScript code!**

- Note that a .env with DEV_PORT, and a NODE_ENV flag (=production or development) are needed.

Alternatively, you can select "Continue as guest" on the login page of the app, which will not use any features that rely on the server (authentication and saving project data.)

npm run dev
npm run electron-dev
```

## Run Exported App
